# Screen-Sharing
This is a simple java based application which allows you to share your screen over LAN and also allows remote control.It uses UDP protocol for sending the packets over the network and displays the remote screen on a simple frame in a size compressed manner.

## How it works?
- The usage is very simple.Just install the program on both controller as well as victim's computer
- Start the Receiver's Side first.Then start Server's side.
- That's it.You can now share your screens!

## Important things to notice:
- It does not have any User interface.It is purely command line based.
- Only the Victim's screen is shown on a simple frame.

## Bugs:
- The application tends to show half or pixelated image if the size becomes larger.
- Flow of events is not done.
